### Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
The client was Artemis Financial who wanted secure and encrypted communications for their application to prevent vulnerabilities in security. I worked with Global Rain to manage the security of the Artemis Financial application which required file verification to ensure secure communications between client and server.

### What did you do particularly well in identifying their software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a companyâ€™s overall wellbeing?
I did particularly well in identifying which plugins and software need to be updated based on the dependency check report which was generated to highlight vulnerabilities in some plugins used for the program. It is important to code securely to prevent attackers from obtaining confidential information from the application especially when this application deals with financial information. Software security ensures that a company can be respected while maintaining a good track record in terms of preventing leaks in customer information which leads customers to see the company as a safe place to do business.

### What about the process of working through the vulnerability assessment did you find challenging or helpful?
I found generating a new keytool to be fairly difficult since I had trouble placing it in the correct directory and found the previous assignments to be helpful in generating a checksum.

### How did you approach the need to increase layers of security? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to assess vulnerabilities and determine mitigation techniques?
To increase layers of security, I secured APIs by the use of mapping within my code and secured communications between the user and the application. In the future, I will generate dependency check reports to make sure everything is up to date without any vulnerabilities and I will identify areas in a system where vulnerabilities may exist and will refactor the code to ensure secure and high quality code. 

### How did you ensure the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
I ensured the code and software application were functional and secure by checking the dependency check report to ensure no new vulnerabilites were introduced after refactoring the code. I also made sure communications using web APIs were secure by catching potential errors and encrypting data with SHA-256 using RSA encryption.

### What resources, tools, or coding practices did you employ that you might find helpful in future assignments or tasks?
I used the included resources in the modules that had tutorials for dealing with encryption and communications between client and server. Another coding practice that helped me was the vulnerability report which showed where vulnerabilites may be present in the system.

### Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to demonstrate your skills, knowledge, and experience. What from this particular assignment might you want to showcase to a future employer?
I would like to showcase the use of SHA-256 with RSA encryption to encrypt data since encryption/security is very important in the technology field. I will also showcase my ability to generate certificates to establish trust for a website or program along with how I generated dependency check reports to identify areas of security that may be vulnerable to attacks.
